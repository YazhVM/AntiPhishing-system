# AntiPhishing-system
A deep learning solution to phishing website detection. The solution uses an ensemble model, meaning it combines LSTM and CNN to detect phishing websites. 
The dataset is balanced perfectly. The data distribution plot is also shown. 
There is a simple UI component included in the project, where in the user can type an URL and find if it is phishing or not. 
The solution has been achieved after testing the model by tuning the hyperparameters and choosing the best performing model from it. The model has been trained for 200 epochs.  
The model architecture has been visualized using built-in tools and the diagram has been included in the repository.
The accuracy achieved is 96%.
The precision achieved for legitimate and phishing classes are 95% and 97% respectively, which is far good than the existing solutions.
